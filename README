pixivrss.pl - a Pixiv "bookmarks" RSS feed generator.

To set up, just drop the script in some directory on your web server,
change the variables under "config" to match your setup, and add the
scripts URL to your favourite feed reader.

Please make sure you're not hammering Pixiv's servers with a lot of
unneccesary requests.

DANGER WILL ROBINSON: This obviously makes something that was private
(your bookmarks) public. If you don't want anyone to see those, you
should probably put this script behind .htaccess protection or such.
