pixivrss.pl - a Pixiv "bookmarks" RSS feed generator.

To set up, just drop the script in some directory on your web server,
change the variables under "config" to match your setup, and add the
scripts URL to your favourite feed reader.

Please make sure you're not hammering Pixivs servers with a lot of
unneccesary requests.
